# Release notes

January 28, 2020

The SQLite3 shell applications are now compatible with the official
SQLite3 shell in respect to the compile time options
`SQLITE_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB`, `SQLITE_ENABLE_STMTVTAB`, and
`SQLITE_ENABLE_UNKNOWN_SQL_FUNCTION`.

Starting from October 2019 separate archives are provided with resp.
without enabled ICU support for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.

ICU support for SQLite3 is currently based on the pre-built ICU
Libraries v65.1, which were compiled with Visual Studio 2017.
The required ICU DLLs are now included in the archives in folder `bin`.
They were downloaded from

https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/releases/latest

In addition, the Visual C++ 2017 runtime is required to be installed,
because the ICU DLLs depend on it.

## Archive content

1) `wxsqlite3-sqlite3-x.y.z-win32.zip` - 32-bit Windows without ICU support
