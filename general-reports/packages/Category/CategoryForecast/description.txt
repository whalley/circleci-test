Category Forecast Report Using Repeating Transactions

This report will calculate the transactions for the current year in a given category and then use the remaining repeating transactions to forecast the total for the category at year's end.

LIMITATIONS/KNOWN ISSUES:
Does not include split transactions.
Only works for an entire category, not individual subcategories.

USAGE:
Update category name in line 15 of the SQL.

SIMPLE EXAMPLE: 

The checking account has a repeating transaction of $10 monthly with category "Donation". There were also incidental transactions with the "Donation" category, $3 in Feb and $4 in March. It is currently July. The report will return the following:

Current Total: $77
Projected Total: $127
